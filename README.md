just a simple script to edit multiple folder name, to replace characters.

I needed it to replace the space between word and add underscore.

just run
`go run main.go`

type the path for the folder you need, you can use both absolute and relative.

`./testingFolder`

type the char to replace or SPACE for spaces

type the char to use as a replacement or SPACE for spaces
